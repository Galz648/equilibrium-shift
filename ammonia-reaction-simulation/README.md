# ammonia-reaction-simulation

### TODO:

-
  - [ ] Create a diagram that describes the reaction model, how external
        distrubances affect the model, steady states, la chatelier's principle
- [x] create public interface for the library The reaction should be dictated by
      three equations:
  - first rate equation expression (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃ <- is first rate)
  - Arrhenius equation (depends on temperature (T), activation energy (E_a),
    frequency factor (A))
  - Equlibrium constant K

  -
  - [x] make adhoc solution for passing the controls to the simulation step
        function `derivatives`, such as heat input, given by `Controls`
  - [ ] decouple the visualization logic of the simulation, by moving the code
        to an example > examples/
-
  - [ ] resolve the naming conflict between reactor state and simulator state,
        they are used interchangibly inside `rk4` intergrator function

### Examples

##### todo!

### Units

KJ for energy kelvin for temperature

### Constants

### unknowns

- how to measure concentrations?
- wrap around how to compute the reverse rate
- how to calculate the pre-exponential factor
- where does time come into play ?
- how to compute the number of moles reacted based on concentration and volume ?

### Simulation Parameters

- concentrations (N2, H2, NH3)
- temperature

### Simulation pipeline

1. Computer forward rate constant (Arrhenius Equation)
2. Compute equilibrium constant (thermodynamics)
3. Compute reverse rate constant
4. plug into rate law
5. use rate in diff equations
